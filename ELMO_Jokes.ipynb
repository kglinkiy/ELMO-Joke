A little old barefoot man wearing overalls answered the knock on the door, only to be confronted by the very well dressed and dignified CEO in a $2,000 navy blue pin-striped business suit, a Hermes silk tie, a starched white shirt with monogrammed cufflinks, $700 shoes polished like black mirrors, and carrying a vacuum cleaner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good morning,\" said the well-dressed and impeccably groomed CEO. \"If I could take a couple minutes of your time, I would like to demonstrate the very latest in high-powered vacuum cleaners.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get lost, Mister fancy suit!\" said the old man. \"I haven\\'t got any money\" and he proceeded to close the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuick as a flash, the CEO wedged his polished shoe in the door and pushed it wide open.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be too hasty!\" he said. \"Not until you have at least seen my demonstration.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man again told him to get lost. And with that, the CEO emptied a bucket of mud all over his hallway carpet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If this vacuum cleaner does not remove all traces of this mess from your carpet, sir, I will personally eat the remainder. I am the CEO! You have my GUARANTEE!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I got a better idea\" said the old man, \"If you don\\'t clean it all up, I\\'ll swap those fancy clothes of yours fer my overalls. Your nice suit, your tie, your shoes, everything!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fine, sir!\" said the CEO confidently. \"I\\'ll give you my clothes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lemme ask you somethin\\', pal...Where are you goin\\' when you leave here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CEO answered very confidently: \"To a VERY important conference! WHY?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will they let you in if yer barefoot?\" said the old man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course not!\" said the CEO.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How much did you pay for those socks you\\'v got on?\" asked the old man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fifty dollars\" said the bewildered CEO.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ain\\'t never worn fifty dollar socks before!\" said the old man. \"It will be kinda hard for you to wear overalls to work, I guess!\" said the old man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"WHAT?!\" said the confused CEO.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And will you show how me to tie a necktie?\" said the old man...\\r\\n\\r\\nOne hour later, the door of the apartment opened, and the CEO carefully looked out. Seeing that no one was around, his foot appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bare foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped out into the hallway - dressed only in overalls and bare feet. His expensive executive suit and tie had vanished, along with his confidence and dignity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man watched him run away to his car with a grin, admiring the expensive pinstriped suit and silk tie he had just acquired. He then sat down and pulled on the CEO\\'s fifty dollar socks and gleaming shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I gotta see about payin\\' that electric bill...\"'"
